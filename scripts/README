Assuming the dependencies for the top-level project have been installed, running `bash run_all.sh t`, where `t` is an integer corresponding to the number of threads to run Julia with, will run all of the counting and simulations for figures 5, 9, and 10 from the paper. We then use `python` to plot the results in `motif_sampling_results.ipynb`. The results for supplementary figures 7 and 8 can be generated using `structure_test.jl` and `sampling_divergence.jl`, respectively.
